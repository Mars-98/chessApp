2 players on one computer. No need localhost or internet connectivity
In Python 3.8.3, GitHub hosted by Mariam, git-bash (or similar), userstories in some software and Pycharm

ui with Tim and Connor:
	PyGame or SimplePyGui (Probably PyGame)
	Thumbnails of the pieces
	chessboard
	each piece linking up with the corresponding class in the backend
	scoreboard
	On first click, show where piece can move. Then move the piece or put it back down.

api with Peter and Mariam:
	Mostly logic
	Classes of each piece
		Parent called "Piece"
		Child classes of piece
	Win condition
		Some way to tell if someone has won or not
	Scoring with player 1 and player 2
	Try to unittest

Onboarding + goals:
	Getting used to user stories and asigning points and git shtuff
		Base branch of develop -> branch off of it for each user story -> code -> Do a pull request (Tim reviewing)
		Don't merge with develop ever
		Develop is the shared of everyone
	Working as a team
	Try not to look "how to make chess app in python" or something similar
